A repository of course materials for Duquesne University's Data Science 3 course

# Syllabus
We will have days that alternate theory with practice. Practice will involve both my coding in front of you, as well as taking turns coding in front of each other. Given that many job interviews require public coding, this is excellent, if occasionally challenging experience.

Note that plans will change as we adapt the course to the interests of everyone in the course.

# Grading

Grades in this class are based on creating tools that are readable, runnable, and well-documented. Evaluations will be from a combination of class participation and code written for regular homeworks throughout the semester. Ample time will be given for homeworks, and they should be viewed both as a chance to practice and a mechanism of expanding the documented code in your Github (which will help with future jobs). Collaboration is highly valued, but if overly similar code is submitted, I reserve the right to request independent explanations of how the code works and the thought behind its organization.

## Final exam
The final exam will be a job interview. It will be comprised of the following portions:

- Evaluation of Github, all of which will be filled in the previous weeks (is there high-quality Python code with functions, documentation, and a cohesive project)
- Description of previous work
- Coding challenge

If you cared about your work during the semester and have put substantial effort into your Github, the weight of the coding challenge will decrease.


# Notes
1. Set up your own Github account
1. Github accounts should include at least one example of Python, with docstrings
1. I recommend using vscode + venv for installation
1. Let's use Python 3.8+
